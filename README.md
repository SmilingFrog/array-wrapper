# array-wrapper
Provides some wrapper classes that allow to work with a one dimensional array as if it were a two dimensional array and vice versa.
You have a one dimensional array, but you need to work with it as if it were a two dimensional array. 
Wrap your one dimensional array into the wrapper class and use a simple and streightforward interface to work with it.
The wrapper classes are backed by the initial array (one dimensional or two dimensional). They do not by defaut create new arrays. 
But, you can use wrapper classes to create new array (two dimensional from a one dimensional or vice versa).

Currently, there is only one version of the wrapper for one dimensional and two dimensional arrays of integers.
